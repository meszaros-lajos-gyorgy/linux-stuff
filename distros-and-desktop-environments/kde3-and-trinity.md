# KDE 3

My first experience with linux was with a pentest live CD that came before Kali Linux/Backtrack:

Max Moser's Auditor Security Collection

It ran Knoppix based on [KDE 3.x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Desktop_Environment_3), which had a nice
Windows XP-ish look to it that I really liked.

The last KDE minor version of 3.x was forked as [Trinity Desktop Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Desktop_Environment).

I tried [installing it](https://wiki.trinitydesktop.org/Ubuntu_Trinity_Repository_Installation_Instructions) in
a VM for [Trisquel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisquel), but it seems to have a few flaws, even the mouse
movement isn't that smooth.

This comment says that it is using [out of date stuff under the hood](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/a8i5fq/comment/ecbf3jh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
